#tuples:
#tuples are write protected and faster than lists to iterate

#Dictionaries:
#Dictionaries are known to associate each key with a value, while lists just contain values.
#Use a dictionary when you have an unordered set of unique keys that map to values.
#Note that, because you have keys and values that link to each other, the performance will be better than lists in cases where youâ€™re checking membership of an element.

#sets: You should make use of sets when you have an unordered set of unique, immutable values that are hashable.

# Check if a dictionary is hashable
print(isinstance({}, collections.Hashable))

# Check if a float is hashable
print(isinstance(0.125, collections.Hashable))
